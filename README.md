# SBOM for OpenSSF Critical Projects

This repository contains the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for OpenSSF critical projects. It serves as a silo for SBOMs, providing a centralized location for these essential documents.

## Overview

The SBOMs in this repository are generated using the [bomfactory](https://github.com/bitbomdev/bomfactory) tool. This tool automates the process of downloading SBOMs for multiple repositories, addressing the lack of tools for easily obtaining SBOMs, which are crucial for software testing and security analysis.

## Motivation

Currently, there is no straightforward way to obtain SBOMs for critical projects. This repository aims to fill that gap by providing a collection of SBOMs for OpenSSF critical projects.

## Usage

To generate SBOMs for your own projects, you can use the `bomfactory` tool. For more information on how to use `bomfactory`, please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/bitbomdev/bomfactory).
